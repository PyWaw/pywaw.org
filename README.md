### About PyWaw
PyWaw is a community that gathers Python hobbyists from Warsaw and its surroundings. This project is aimed at not only Computer Sciences students or professional developers, but also all of you who have just started the Python experience. Our goals are various â€“ exchange our experiences and ideas, integration of Python people in Warsaw and spreading the fame of Python as a universal programming language. Our meetings are held every second (or third) Monday of a month. Feel free to join us anytime!
